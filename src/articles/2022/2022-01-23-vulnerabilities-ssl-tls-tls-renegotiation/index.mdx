title: "Vulnerabilities in SSL & TLS :- TLS  Renegotiation"
date: "2022-01-23"
description: "In this article, we will look at the TLS Renegotiation Vulnerability in the SSL and TLS protocols. This is a plaintext injection attack into previously sent packets. TLS and SSL 3.0 do not correctly associate renegotiation handshakes with existing connections. This allows a person-in-the-middle positioned attacker to insert data into a HTTPS session."
