title: "Vulnerabilities in SSL & TLS :- POODLE over TLS"
date: "2022-01-20"
description: "In this article, we will look at CVE-2014-8730, also known as the Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Over Transport Layer Security (POODLE over TLS) vulnerability. The vulnerability is caused by a TLS server failing to verify the block cipher padding when used with a cipher suite utilising a block cipher, such as AES and DES. Due to the lack of padding checking, encrypted TLS traffic can be decrypted."
